// 1. Import react ðŸ’¡

export default function PersonDetails() {
  /**
      2. Create a new component so that it receives an `Object`
      through props called `user` that follows this structure:
      user = {
        name: "John",
        lastName: "Doe",
        favoriteGenre: "EDM",
      }
      
      2.1 You can then access user.name through `props` and render each field
      In your component. For example: "favorite music genre: edm"

      2.2 Add a new prop called `sayCatchPhrase` which receives a lambda / function that console.logs 
      The user's chatch phrase

      2.3 Create a button and add the sayCathPhrase function to the onClick handler of that button
      
      2.4 Add a 'say catch phrase' text to the button
